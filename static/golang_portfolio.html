            <h1>Golang Portfolio</h1>
            <p>A couple of years ago I started experimenting with new programming languages. Up to that point I was mainly working with C++ and I wanted to try out more moderns languages with with simpler compilation processes ( anything other CMake, make or having to deal with linking static libraries in xcode or visual studio)</p>

<p>That’s when I ran into go and was really moved by the talk by <strong>Rob Pike - Simplicity is complicated</strong></p>

<iframe width="640" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFejpH_tAHM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>And decided to dive into the language and do a series of small projects with it. One of these projects is this static website/portfolio generated by GO.</p>

<p>The Repo is divided into a couple of parts:</p>

<p><strong>Projects</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>A project is defined by a json file pointing to a markdown or html file for the actual writting and a data folder (for, images, videos specific to that project)</li>
<li>a input folder containing all the projects</li>
<li>a json file defining what projects will be compiled into what category (projects, Experiments or Archive )</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Build system</strong></p>

<p>It’s in charge of collecting all the projects from the data folder and creating their corresponded HTML page from a markdown or raw text.</p>

<p>It also generates the common components used in the website like header, index, experiments and archive page.</p>

<p><strong>Server</strong></p>

<p>A simple static server using golang standard libraries, it re-generates the HTML at every page, and it’s mainly used as a quick hot-reload development cycle</p>

<h3>Program Flow</h3>

<ol>
<li>The program reads the json file defining the projects and renders an HTML page, then copies the files (if changed, see bellow) inside data into a static output folder</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>File Caching</strong></p>

<p>For every file inside data folder, the program runs a MD5 hash and saves that into a <code>cache.json</code> file, if on the next run the MD5 hash is the same one inside the cache file definition, it skips copying the file to the output build saving some time and resources.</p>

<p>example of cache:</p>

		&quot;assets/data/akamai_sculpture/akamai_thumbnail.mp4&quot;: &quot;16b756e8c67e3ea6c887d75a81a54bea&quot;,

... 
}

<p><strong>Good Parts:</strong></p>

<p>I was really impressed of how much you can accomplish with such a simple language, for example GO only has <code>array</code>, <code>slices</code> and <code>map</code> for container like structures. Comming from  c++ where you have <code>map</code>, <code>unordered_map</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>set</code> etc..  having just two options was , but with time you only really need those data structures, if you need something more complex you can search a library.</p>

<p>With c++ I always trouble figuring it out if wrote software was using the correct abstraction, with GO you only have a couple of options and it’s really a refreshing feeling because you can focus on finshing the project.</p>

<p><strong>The bad parts:</strong></p>

<p>This project doesn’t really utilize GO’s main feature: concurrency. While there are many parts that that could be applied, generating the projects, rendering the HTML and copying the files</p>
